# webtraffic

This project is a web frontend to [bussim](https://github.com/spencer-p/bussim)
which is written on top of my [traffic](https://github.com/spencer-p/traffic)
library for simulating transportation networks.

I wrote the above projects to analyze traffic in LA for a project.  I wrote this
project to make those simulation programs more accessible to my less techy
group members, and to have a public place to share the simulations we ran. If
you'd like to know more, I encourage you to check out the links above.
