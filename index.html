<h1>Traffic Simulation</h1>
<p>Welcome to the traffic simulation web portal. You may want to bookmark this
home page since there are no navigational links on the other pages. Sorry about
that.</p>
<p>If you don't know what this is, you probably shouldn't be here. Alternatively
you can take a look at <a href="https://github.com/spencer-p/traffic">this
repository</a> for some more info.</p>
<p>A note to simulation runners - I didn't make it very easy to distinguish
between inputs. Every iteration gets essentially a random number assigned to it
(a hash of the input string). Since there is no title or helpful metadata, I
suggest you add an unused "Note" or "Title" field to the input JSON like so:</p>
<p><code style="white-space: pre-wrap">
	{
		"Note": "This simulation is testing whether or not cars == good.",
		"BusRouteInfo": [
			...
		],
		"CarRouteInfo": [
			...
		],
		...
	}
</code></p>
<p>Remember the comma after the extra line! Note that the "Note" string can be any
text, as long as it does not collide with the other keys. Hope that helps.</p>
